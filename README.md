FRCFMSTwitterParse

This is a java feed fetcher specifically to fetch the newest tweet of @frcfms

It takes the tweet and uses RegEx to format it in a more readable format.

This runs from console once ran, requires internet and access to Twitter.com (well, api.twitter.com)

Feel free to use, just give credit where credit is due!
